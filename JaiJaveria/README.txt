Beginner: Splash Screen

I have created a splash screen around the precautions one needs to take in the pandemic.

Usage Instructions 

It has 3 screens and one could swipe left or right to navigate among them. There is also 3 dots at the bottom which helps in identifying the current page the user is at. The one dot which is red in color, while the others are orange, shows you the current page.

Intermediate: ToDo List App 

I have made a ToDo App where you could add/edit and delete tasks/events that are scheduled in the future. 

Usage Instructions 

On the main screen you can see a list of tasks that are upcoming along with their date and time. U can add more tasks by clicking on the bottom right button 'ADD TASK'. During this you can also provide a description for the same which is visible after clicking on a task in the task list. Clicking on the same also pops up another window where one can update or delete the particular task.
