# QR Scanner App

This application can scan a barcode using phone's main camera and decode the content and display it.

Libraries used: 
1. Zxing - For creating QR code scanner Intent Integrator which initiates scan and then we parse the code and get Intent result which contains the decoded informatiion.
2. Picasso - I have also added an image from a URL into the app using Picasso, just for beautification effect.
