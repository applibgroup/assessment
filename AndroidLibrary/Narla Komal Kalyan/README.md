# Android Library Assessment
This is a simple Photo Gallery App. It displays the list of photos (in your external storage like sd card) in the grid format and on clicking on the photo we can view that particular photo individually and can zoom in the photo to view it properly. I have used Picasso Library in this app. It is used to load the images into the imageviews. By using the image path from the external storage, the corresponding image file is displayed in imageview using Picasso Library.
