# Top Libraries Assignment
The Application TopLibrariesAssignment was made by using two of the top 10 open-source libraries: Picasso and Retrofit.
The Application is a mockup of a toursim app that displays interesting places to visit in cities. Its features are:
* Browse through multiple cities through tabs made for each city.
* Scroll through multiple locations to visit inside each city.
* Location data is fetched from online Json documents through Rest API calls using Retrofit.
* An associated image of the location (URL fetched through API) is displayed using Picasso and ImageView.
* In the absence of a dedicated location API, a mock API was created and hosted in Github pages: https://elaitenstile.github.io/touristapi-test/
