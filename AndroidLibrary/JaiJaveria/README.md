I have made a news app where one can check the latest headlines relating to business or entertainment or general news related to India. This is the same as my submission for the self study news app. In this version I have made some more feature additions. Now one can also generate a QR code for the new url so that one can share it easily. I have used Retrofit for network connection, Zxing for QR code generation, Picasso for image loading libraries and Lottie for inserting animations in this project. I have also used the newsapi.org API to get the latest top headlines in India.

Usage Instructions 

On the main screen one sees general headlines. The top left corner has a navigation drawer where one could change the news categories. Clicking on a particular news opens the full news article on chrome insde the app itself. There is also a share option which when clicked generates the corresponding QR code.
