## TOPIC
## 1. Create a News Feed Application which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet.
a. You can use any News API which is a well maintained API which
returns information in a JSON format.
b. Features we are looking for in the app are
i. Navigation Drawer
ii. Layout Adapter and Network usage to retrieve the data.
iii. Linear Layout with RecyclerView to display/load the feeds.
iv. Main page with the Feed and Detailed page when clicked on
an individual feed.
 UI is purely your choice, but ensure we have two screens, one for the feed and
second screen to display the details of the feed.
